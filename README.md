# React Native - Expense Tracker
Demo application to learn React Native, with navigation, state management using Context and Http requests.

The app shows expenses that the user has registered. There are two tabs: Recent and All.

The Recent tab shows expenses from the past 7 days, while All shows all expenses.

The user can add a new expense, and edit or delete an existing one.

All of the data is saved on Firebase. Please set you firebase storage URL in the `/util/http.js` file.
